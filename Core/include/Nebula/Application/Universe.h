// each named, as its objectName, after its component and a number, e.g. Greeter1. It is read from a project file, as
// NebulaStudio writes them, see README.md, or assembled with instantiate() and Component::bindInterface().
// A project file is a galaxy, named after its file: readGalaxy() tells what it is without loading it, and
// missingPlugins() whether it can be loaded.
// It is either edited or running, as its components are. While it runs, it is not assembled: its components are
// neither instantiated, renamed nor removed. What changes their properties meanwhile, its settings files or its
// components themselves, is undone once it stops: they have the values of the edition again, the ones save() writes.
// Its settings files hold the properties its user changes while it runs, and finds again the next time: see
// SettingsFile.
// It needs a QCoreApplication, and a QApplication as soon as one of its components shows a widget.

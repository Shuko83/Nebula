// The zone where the application is assembled: a component dragged from a ComponentModel and dropped here is
// instantiated in the application, and shown where it was dropped. Dragging from the dot of an interface to the dot of
// one it can be bound to, a provided and a consumed one of the same type, binds them and draws a link between them;
// meanwhile, the interfaces it cannot be bound to are dimmed. Its context menu adds a zone, which groups components,
// see ZoneItem, unless it is opened on a component, and renames, recolors or removes the one under the cursor; it
// renames and recolors the component under the cursor too, see ComponentItem. A component keeps a name no other one of
// the application has: see refused().
// The same menu removes the component under the cursor from the application, with its links, and the Delete key
// removes the selected ones.
// The menu adds a settings file of the application as well, see SettingsItem, whose properties are chosen at once, and
// again when it is double-clicked or from its own menu, which writes its default values or removes it.
// None of this is done while the application runs, see Universe: its components can still be selected, but
// nothing is dropped, moved, linked, renamed, recolored, added or removed until it is stopped.
// A galaxy dragged from a GalaxyModel is placed in the application the same way, see Universe::instantiateGalaxy();
// double-clicking it below its name asks for it to be opened, see galaxyOpened(), in another scene that shows it
// without editing it.

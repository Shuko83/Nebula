// interface it cannot do without is bound to nothing, see Component::unboundMandatoryInterfaces(); its tooltip names
// them and tells how to bind them. It can be selected, and, while it is editable, moved, and its name edited in place
// by double-clicking its names. It can be given a color, which its names are written over.
